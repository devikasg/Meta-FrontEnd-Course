WEEK 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Hypertext Markup language - Hypertext is text which contains links to another page
Markup is tags and elements used within a document

Opening Tag <p>
Closing tag </p>
<br> is a self closing tag

W3C consortium - (workd wide web) maintains the HTML standard
ALT text or image description is displayed nowhere in the webpage - but it is used by search engine etc which might improve the ranking of our website


HTML FORMS
<form action="/registration" method="POST"> </form>
action tells us the path to which the form should be submitted to 
when no action is specified - request is submitted to the same webpage

Inputs : 
<form action = '/registration' method="POST">
    <label for="username">Username:</label><br>
    <input type = "text" name = "username">

    <label for="password"> Password:</label><br>
    <input type = "password" />

    <input type="submit"/>
</form>

There are checkboxes and radio buttons, number, email, file upload, multiline text field also
Multiline text and dropdown don't use input tags

DOM - DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
To make websites interactive, we need DOM - to add comments, like stuff etc
When browser received a html page, it constructs a DOM 
It's a tree structure
One object represents one html element
We can use Javascript to access and modify the DOM 
Using many <br> tags or not putting content in appropriate tags can reduce web acessibility


CSS 
Selector 

Following h1 selector tells us to put all h1 headings in grey. h1 is selector, Color is the property and grey is the value.
h1{
    color : grey;
    background-color : black;
}


TYPES OF SELECTORS

Element Selector - select HTML elements based on their element type 

ID selector - id attribute of an HTML element - We use # character for ID 
For example, 
<span id = "latest">New!</span>
#latest{
    background-color: purple;
}

Class Selector - uses dot operator
HTML
​<a class="navigation">Go Back</a>
​<p class="navigation">Go Forward</p>

CSS
.navigation { 
    margin: 2px;
  }​​

Element + Class
The example below selects all p elements that have the CSS class introduction applied to them.
<p class="introduction"></a> -- HTML
CSS
p.introduction { 
    margin: 2px;
    }​​

Multiple selectors can be selected - separate all by space - for example - select all h1
elements that are contained within the element with the ID blog - #blog h1 {}


Child selectors
Only select elements that are immediate descendants of selectors 


COLOURS
RGBA - A alpha channel for opacity, transparency of the color
HSL - hue, saturation, lightness
Hex - rgb 255 0 0 is ff000 in hex
