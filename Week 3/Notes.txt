Package manager is a tool that installs all dependencies/packages
Node Package manager (NPM) is the most common 

Bundling tool - eg Gulp Webpack - combine all dependencies into one single file

Responsive Design 
Flexible grids - columns, gutters (space between columns) and margins - defined in percentages so that they can adjust acc to screen size
Fluid Images - setting max_width to 100% ensures that if the column becomes smaller - image becomes smaller - but never larger
Media Queries - display size, orientation, aspect ratio

Pixel value specified is the breakpoint. 

Three different grids 
Fixed grid - fixed width columns and flexible margins. So a fixed grid has a fixed content width that doesn't change in a specific breakpoint range.
Fluid grid - flexible content, fixed gutters and margins
Hybrid - fluid width and fixed width content

Bootstrap - prewritten chunks of code in css and js
